        <p class="lead mb-4">Lauren is a second-year English major. She is a part of a professional business fraternity and joined during the spring quarter of her first year of college. She attends UC Riverside and has always wanted to attend college in Southern California. She has always had a passion for English and the subjectivity of writing. Her favorite part of writing is finding her own style of writing. Because of this, she really enjoys reading and writing poetry and analyzing the diction behind the type of writing styles the authors write with. Her passion for writing stemmed from when she was a child. She would carry around a notebook with lined paper and write whatever inspired her throughout the day to create a story. She is definitely on the more creative end of things instead of on the more scientific, mathematical side. Her stronger suits have always been with artistic hobbies including dance, cheerleading, drawing, painting, violin, piano, and singing. She went to an extremely competitive high school called Dougherty Valley High School in San Ramon, California. This made her realize that a lot of her efforts toward academics, no matter how hard she tried, would end up not meeting her expectations since she is not naturally gifted in science or math. Her skills were naturally geared more toward subjective matters which is why she has always been more educated in more creative or moldable subjects. Second-year English major Lauren.

As a result, she finds poetry to be incredibly enjoyable to read, create, and analyze the language used by different authors. Her love of writing began when she was a little girl. Everywhere she went, she kept a notepad with lined paper in which she would jot down any ideas for stories that came to mind.
